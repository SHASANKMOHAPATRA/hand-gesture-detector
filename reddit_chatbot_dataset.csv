Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\n\n1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We\'ve been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We\'ve been seeing these movements all week.\n\n2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn\'t work.\n\n3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\n\n4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\n\n5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\n\n6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\n\n7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\n\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn\'t let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that\'s true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\n\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.

Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**\n\n\nWe the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.\n\n\n**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year.

Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*\n\n\n**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions.

Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme\n\nIf you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.\n\nShares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!\n\nAdditionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.\n\n🚀🚀🚀\n\nTHEY WANNA SHUT US DOWN ON ROBINHOOD, WE AINT BACKING DOWN.

You guys know what to do."", '> In the last generation most of the people thought about the stock market as something abstract and only reserved to the richest getting richer, only having a clue about what Wall Street is thanks to movies.\n\nI don\'t know if that\'s entirely true, I\'ve been playing the markets since the 1990s, probably my mid-30s. I was in software development and a lot of us started getting into it because that was when you first were able to trade stocks online. But then you did say ""most people"", so you could still be right.\n\nBefore the 1990s, you had to have a broker, like an actual person, and one person with a business card, not an interchangeable call center contact. You could only buy in 100 unit blocks, and you had to have your money all set up, and there were fairly high minimums just to be allowed to trade, it was a big hassle. Most people were in the market anyway, with mutual funds in their 401K plans. You couldn\'t really trade, but you could at least participate in the market, so most people in that situation would follow the stock market. \n\nI remember when a real estate bubble popped in 1987, a sell off started and I just ignored it, but my co-worker lamented that he spent the whole day trying to get through to his broker. He was lucky he didn\'t! He would have lost a lot selling in a panic, but he cooled down and just held onto it after that, and came out ok.\n\nWhat you kiddoes are doing is pretty cool though, and it\'s true that y\'all are deep into stocks at a much earlier age than was even possible before. I\'ve been following wsb for a while, and even made some money off of their tips. One thing I love about what you\'re doing is that you aren\'t afraid of losing money.\n\nThe only way to really learn is to put money into it. Before you do that, it\'s just all to abstract to care about, but once your own money is at stake, you become hyper aware, your brain becomes far more able to absorb knowledge and data, and to achieve some understanding of what\'s going on.\n\nOne thing I find funny is that the local news stations are all treating this as one of their lite, smiley stories. It\'s great to see these GenX newscasters cheerily talking about ""Wall Street Bets"", subreddits, Robinhood, short selling, and hedge funds like ""Oh those cute l\'il Zoomers!"" They have interviews with local investors (I\'m in Dallas), and they\'re all ""Well, it\'s great to see young people getting so involved in investing. I just hope they don\'t lose too much money at it <chuckle>.""\n\nI guess what I\'m saying is, the underlying attitude is ""Yeah, fuck those hedge fund managers!""

We provided many investment firms, funds, banks, etc with their data. Currencies trade constantly. The close price for a currency is the last reported trade for the day, within a specific timezone. The year end close - i.e. the last trade of the year - is especially important as it is used in a lot of different calculations and valuations for offshore funds.\n\nOne new years day I received a call telling me that the year end close for one currency was wrong. WTF does that even mean? I logged on, and had a look at the logs and timeseries. Everything looked mostly normal. There was a bit of volatility, which was unusual to happen leading up to midnight, but not unheard of. I checked our competitors and other sources and saw the exact same figure. \n\nI replied back saying that the data was correct, provided trades leading up to and after the trade used for the end-of-year close. There was like a percent spread over a time period. Nothing worry some at all. Except to the fund manager. \n\nTheir fee was based on their fund's performance. And their fund had underperformed to a point that the 1% difference in the close they wanted versus were given meant that they couldn't pay themselves that fee (and also had to explain to their investors). \n\nI couldn't care about their issues. The data was correct and I closed the issue. An hour later I received a call from my boss. I explained the situation. I could have changed the data (I was one of 3 who had the rights), but correcting data was done rarely. A half hour after that, I received a call from my boss and his boss. We spoke about it. I was asked how quickly I could change the data. I lied and said it would take many hours, but it took me a few seconds. If we changed the end of year close, we'd have to notify all customers of the change. And explain why we had to do it. And get them to redo all of their calculations on their models, valuations, etc.\n\nThe third phone call included the c-level.

Wall street fund managers had been colluding using a market vehicle called a short which is a bet against a company. But with the billions  available to a hedge fund they can actually devalue the company with such a technique, and with each penny change in stock price they made millions (or more) and then passed it off to another fund that made millions in the next penny decline. The result of this being so successful that wall street actually had more short positions outstanding than GME had shares outstanding...enter the analyst who\'d been buying the shares and over 2 years following the stock who calls out this illegal collusion AND the precarious position the hedge funds created for themselves. \n\nDue to their short positions, at some point the hedge funds legally have to (literally) buy the stock at a later date. If you or I or Jenny from the block all hold the shares of stock, they have to buy it from us. If you hold it and wait, the price will go up because demand is increasing and with time their positions get more precarious, and ultimately they will stop waiting us out and start competing with other hedge funds to buy out these shorts as quickly as possible. And they spend the millions they made devaluing the stocks to pay you at  the higher prices the market now demands for stocks like GME and AMC, and the result is that prices go up and then the next fund buys before it\'s too late and instead of our 401ks getting ruined it is their I\'ll gotten hedge fund gains being depleted. Caveats apply and guaranteed they are trying to avoid this with nefarious and  political/regulatory means but:\n\nIn short (get it??) they are stuck having to pay you with the money they\'ve been scamming from you since they crashed the economy and got bailed out for in 2007-2009. And they will do this by selling the ""reliable"" long stocks that are too popular to easily manipulate like APPL or AMZN and when they take billions out of those stocks to pay you for your shares of GME to cover the positions they are legally bound to cover. As a result the prices of stocks AAPL and most other stocks will artificially decline. And since you have all that money they just paid you for GME or AMC you can then buy AAPL or AMZN at a deep discount, locking in your position there the same way wall street had previously locked you out. So in the end, you own a piece of the stack market that previously had only been accessible to wall street.\n\nAt least in theory. Markets are volatile and this will be a financial battleground individuals always get screwed by the institutions somehow. This isn\'t financial advice, I\'m not a financial advisor,  and I can\'t give you financial advice. \n\nWhat I will say is this: Pundits, politicians, and propagandists (and stock brokers) love a dose of modern activism  because it means donations and click throughs and campaign funds which means revenue which means job security which means their hedge funds get filled and their hedge fund managers collect fees and nothing changes for the people your intention or donation was intended to help. It\'s a system that the elite use to keep themselves elite and there is no trickle down except for the occasional feint they use to placate the masses like the affordable care act which still makes ""them"" more money than it benefits anyone else. But if the system breaks and we end up owning a larger piece of wall street than the general population has ever owned in history, they will reevaluate and change the system that caused them losses. and this moment in history represents a chance to have a voice and a share in that change because we can own it.

There's the board seats, the lobbying positions, the speaking fees, the consultant gigs and [Bob's your uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle) careers for the public servant's spouse, partner, mistress, toy-boy, child, or relative, and the list goes on.\n\nIn return, there's little regulation, and if somebody gets caught, it'll be a slap on the wrist, *usually with no admission of wrongdoing*. They're basically cutting the government an extra check for a small share of the take when they get too greedy and get caught.\n\nHere's a trivia question for you: Do you know how many bankers went to prison for their part in the 2008 market crash?\n\nIn Iceland: 25.\n\nIn the US: 1 (one), and that [fall guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Serageldin) was an Egyptian immigrant working for a Swiss bank.\n\nHe pled guilty in 2013 to *conspiracy to falsify books and records* and received 30 months quality time in federal housing. The SDNY prosecutors had asked for 45 years.\n\nOh, and one year later in 2014, same fall guy [settled with the SEC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-21/ex-credit-suisse-cdo-chief-must-pay-more-than-1-million) to the tune of $1M. His salary in 2007 alone was $7.1M. The damages on the other hand came in at appr. $540M. In other words, the aforementioned slap on the wrist.\n\nTo paraphrase Louis Rossmann, that's the equivalent of parking meters on your street charging 10 bucks per hour, but the parking ticket's just a quarter and the meter maid shows up maybe once a year. Normal people feed the meters, hedge funds wait for the ticket in the mail.\n\nSo don't be surprised that Robinhood, who *allegedly* makes 40% of their revenue lending their customers stocks out to Melvin Capital, and who yesterday banned retail investors from buying volatile stocks right around the time when Citadel (who had just [injected $2B](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/citadel-point72-to-invest-275-billion-in-melvin-capital) into Melvin) *allegedly* doubled down on shorts, will end up with a slap on the wrist, some sourpuss faces during congressional hearings, and maybe a new CEO for Robinhood, Melvin Capital, and Citadel.\n\nFun fact: Gabriel Plotkin, the founder and CIO of Melvin Capital, had already been [investigated by the SEC back in 2013](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS310089300120130403) for insider trading, left the crime scene at SAC Capital unscathed, and started his own Wall Street shakedown operation back in 2014.\n\nBonus fun fact: Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve vice-chair, who just got confirmed with 84-15 votes in the US Senate as the next treasury secretary, received [$810K from Citadel](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/yellen-robinhood-citadel-gamestop-speaking-fees) during 2018 to 2020. Oh, and according to a whistleblower, *allegedly* somebody from the White House had called Robinhood before the barred their customers from buying stocks *allegedly* still shorted by Melvin Capital and *allegedly* now also Citadel.\n\nIMHO, if you want to revert a nation back from an [Oligarchy](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) to a functioning democracy, elections must be, above and beyond limited private donations, government-funded (meaning limited funds, reimbursed based on election results) with *no exceptions* for corporations, campaign windows limited, TV airtime balanced, guaranteed, and *fact-checked*. Oh, and if you're not the guy running for office, you can't buy an ad for that guy on social media. Make it a law; I dare you, I *double-dare* you, Mo...\n\nBonus IMHO: Stop this bullshit to register for a party during voter registration. You want to be a member of a political party, join the party, let that party run their primaries on their own dime and time, but stop registering your affiliation with the government, it's none of their fucking business. Once that's out of the way, automatic voter registration is a no-brainer - as it is in most other developed countries on this planet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** When you're a hedge fund, you can sell more houses which you don't own than there are actual houses on the market.

Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n\n 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n\n 5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n\n 6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\n\n 7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\n\n 8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\n\n 9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.\n\nYou're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill."", 'I’ve been telling everyone I can.

Hoping someone with a bit of knowledge might be able to answer me.\n\nI\'ve been reading up a bit, and from what I understand the Estimated Short Interest on GME has hovered around 70 million USD for the last few days, with an apparent drop to 38 million friday according to ortex.com. \n\nSo, over the course of say 4 weeks, that would be an interest of anywhere between 760 - 1400 million. At the same time, covering all the outstanding shorts at the current share price, would roughly be 17 billion. If the share price were to fall to say $250 however, it would already be 4 billion less. Doesn\'t that mean that essentially mean that for the short sellers, the best proposition is to just pay the interest for a month or two, hoping the price goes down? I mean, trying to close the position now would only drive up the share price and their daily expenditure no? \n\nAlso, what makes people think the price might go up to say $1,000 or $5,000? I understand the fundamental idea of dictating the price because of scarcity, but I just don\'t understand why the short sellers would come into a position where they ""have"" to buy. As I understand it, these shorts don\'t expire. So what mechanism are people pointing at that forces short sellers to try and close out their position? Is it because the broker will want the shares back because they think the liquidity of the short seller is becoming in question?\n\nCould be that I\'m missing something very obvious here, or getting some basic stuff wrong. As I said, I don\'t really know much about this, but now that I\'m ""in"" (just a few shares, if it evaporates it\'s fine), I\'d like to understand it better.\n\nEdit: Also, Melvin Capital apparently manages about 13 billion in assets and they got an injection of 2,5 billion. That makes me think that if the stock stays anywhere near these levels, they will simply go bankrupt instead of covering their shorts?

Is someone gonna sell the data that I provide to the hedge funds and invoke a hedge fund blood curse on my progeny? Just simple stuff, please and thanks :)', ' \n\nFirst of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did illegal. Here are a few examples:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)\n\nNow I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.\n\n1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH they wanted to drive the price down!?**\n\nDTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RHand other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.\n\nWhen RH takes a buy order it goes to it\'s clearinghouse to exchange it\'s clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There\'s this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.\n\nIf the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It\'s this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""\n\nNow, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it\'s clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH\'s credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don\'t have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.\n\nThe concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor\'s minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn\'t stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It\'s just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it\'s not built to handle pumps of this scale.\n\n**2. But I was allowed to sell!**\n\nOf course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.\n\n**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**\n\nThinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.\n\n**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**\n\nMelvin already closed their position. There was enough volume for them to do so.\n\nThe short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.\n\nHedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.\n\nMany hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.\n\n**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**\n\nIt could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don’t get margin called, which I don’t expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let’s say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let’s say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.\n\nConsidering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.\n\n**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**\n\nA lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?\n\nWell, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.\n\n**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**\n\nSure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.\n\n**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**\n\nCitadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.\n\n**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**\n\nNot necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don\'t get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)\n\nBut many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not take from thin air. Because against hedge funds is good, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down.

I found this sub by accident and I couldn’t be more thankful that I did. The information shared here has helped me to find a clarity of thought and intention that I never dreamed possible.\n\nWhen I read some of the due diligence here, and the absolutely stunning depth of knowledge shared, I’ve never felt dumber... Some of you are simply brilliant. As an airline pilot flying globally on the 777 I have to have my crap together. I’m a pretty squared away guy, but it’s humbling being here. I truly appreciate your efforts.\n\nANYWAY....  Something I feel everyone needs to familiarize themselves with BEFORE the squeeze starts is the possible restrictions placed on your ability to sell in large dollar amounts on your trading platform.\n\nAfter reading copious amounts of data and beginning to plan my strategy, I found out that even as a Chase Private Client customer, I am restricted from selling above certain dollar amounts and numbers of shares (which I’ll share in a bit).\n\nI am fortunate enough to be able to think about exiting  in blocks of 100 shares well into the 6-figure per-share price range.  Or so I thought...\n\nThankfully I found out that Chase will send certain trades through their “trading desk” for their “review” (instead of just immediately executing the trades as they’ve done with every trade I’ve made since opening my brokerage accounts). That WILL delay the execution of your trade.\n\nThe Chase restrictions on online trades are:\n\nChase will route all trades (market and limit) above 25,000 shares and/or $1M through their trading desk, which could possibly delay your trade a few minutes or MUCH LONGER depending on how busy they are. Think about what a disaster that could be if you are selling AFTER we peak.\n\nThe second (and even worse) restriction is: Any trade for 100,000 shares and/or $3M will be outright rejected and you’ll just get an error message... Imagine the frustration you’d feel if the price is declining and every second is costing you money as you try to figure out what’s happening... (which is why it’s important to have your plan, AND ALL CONTINGENCIES, in place before the squeeze)\n\nOriginally I intended to sell in blocks of 100 shares but each of those transactions would’ve been in the 10’s of millions of dollars each.\n\nI’ve had to adjust my strategy to stay within the parameters of the Chase restrictions...  Unless the price per share goes above $1M, I’m going to trade the requisite number of shares to keep the transactions below $1M each.  If the price goes above that (and I haven’t been a paper-handed bitch and cashed them all out) I’ll be on the phone with Chase getting it done.\n\nBest of luck.\n\n*not financial advice and all that shit 💎👐🦍🍌🍌🍌🚀🌞', 'Remember Thursday?

First they restricted people on RH and IB and others from trading then they orchestrated what seemed like a huge sell off.\n\nIf you look at the volume, this actually didn't happen though and was all just fake. To understand you need to know how they come up with the price in the chart. Basically if somebody sells a stock for $150 dollar, that's your new value in the chart. So basically what they do is, they sell at 300, then at 299, then 298, and so on. They take on a huge risk by doing this because of course they increase their short positions. They did this a lot in the last couple of days, but today they did it three times in a row pushing the price as low as $120. They were hoping that enough people on Reddit and IB would panic sell (because they're unexperienced) and then are unable to buy back once they realize it was all just for show.\n\nNow the thing that saved the day is that at this point this is not just retail investors. At this point there is other institutional investors involved and of course they immediately saw through tnis, waited it out and now pushed the price right back above 200.\n\nWhy 200 you might ask. The highest call that was sold is 200. They're all in the money and some of them expire Friday. What will happen is that whoever sold them needs to buy 100 shares and give them to the call holder. So basically this will lead to very high demand at very limited supply. In fact higher demand than could ever possibly be supplied.\n\nThe real short squeeze hasn't happened. It happened today right before the big drop. I know now what it looks like. Straight up, no dips at all. It went up to 420.69, stayed there for a while (because many people set that as a sell price), then went straight to 444.44 (because people like this number too) and so on. They realized how screwed they are and pulled off their last strategy.\n\nAll day I said why isn't SEC stepping in, this is clear market manipulation, but I realize now why. This is even bigger than I thought. The broker is responsible for making sure their clients don't lose too much money, i.e. by margin calling them. Now Melvin capitals broker (who by the way owns 40% of RH, sees all their transactions and orders and of course was expected to influence them in this way) knows, that if they margin call melvin, they will not be able to cover the cost. So who will pay the rest? If I understand correctly it is the broker who has to pay the rest. I don't know who that broker is and how they're set up, but they will basically go bankrupt immediately and they might have a huge amount of funds in them suddenly being unable to pay out to their other clients. If this will happen, then a global market crash is almost guaranteed.\n\nSo the SEC isn't stepping in, because they don't want this short squeeze to happen. For decades, hedge funds pushed for very loose regulation. Now they've maneuvered themselves into a position of truly infinite loss. I mean at one point I'm very proud of reddit they figured out the loophole, but it's also scary.\n\nI really don't know at this point, what will happen if the squeeze truly happens.\n\nGiven how this battle was fought so far, there's probably more dirty tactics coming."", 'Wall Street exploits economy at the expense of others.\n\nWall Street: ""Life is good.""\n\nReddit exploits economy at the expense of Wall Street.\n\nWall Street: ""Mommy, no fair, regulate this.""', ""I smell a fat class action lawsuit... they screwed up.. but anyway trading for GME has resumed on plenty of other brokers after pelosi comments on investigation of market manipulation with these hedge fund managers... sooo buy while it's LOWER!!

(you can see this in the short sale volume from Ortex for the day).\n\n  \nAt bottom most likely these HFS were most likely buying calls expecting the price to rebound and with the forced liquiditation of retail shares bought on margin they could have easily gobbled up a LOT of shares alongside with the 0tde call options that ended up ITM on Friday close.\n\nThis means that HFS and large instiutions made a killing both on the way down and on the bounce back up to Friday close levels, getting rid of a lot of their ""big loser"" shorts as well as being able to cover a lot of shorts with exercising their call options on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, the thing that people keep missing regarding **HFS and FI\'s is that for naked shorts they DONT HAVE TO COVER.**\n\n**Both Melvin and Citadel, Goldman, MS and others HAVE THE OPTION to pay the clearing house CASH** instead of providing a share at the share Market Price thus they could have just ponied up the shares at Thursday\'s dip without actually purchasing shares from the market.\n\n \\- alongside the ITM call options that they ended up holding by the bell on Friday providing them additional shares by the end of the week.\n\nExpecting the squeeze to happen on Tuesday is also misleading as HFS and MM\'s never cover their shares at the last minute, especially ITM calls, the T+2 settlement date refers to the fact that MM\'s and HFS have 2 business days to legally close down the trade with the Clearing House and with the counterparty as well as to wind down the trade and take on the PnL.\n\n  \nFrom a risk management persective covering calls usually happen well in advance before the call itself expire and always at a price point where its profitable for the MM - I would expect monthly calls were covered at the moment the trade was made (<100USD share price) or at the dip we have seen on Thursday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think there is still a chance for a short squeeze to happen but this hinges on a couple of things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Whether retail is going to be let back into the market with unlimited purchases across Europe and the US (and given DTCC capital requirements this is highly unlikely)\n2. What SIR will be reported on the 9th of Feb - but again you must remember that this will be a different game as the existing shorts that are on the market no longer have such a low ITM price point as it did have previously.

Then why didn\'t he hold those shares and sell at $400. $300. $200?\n\n- In his post history he says he accidentally sold off shares and had to rebuy. Someone who accidentally closes out a position is a red flag for me. An experienced trader doesn\'t do that. It was a stop loss order. Maybe he has another stop loss order placed again but isn\'t talking about that.\n\n- OP posted, two months ago, a strategy to take out a loan for $30K to YOLO on SPCE because it\'s going to $1000. Why? His DD was \'because I say it is"" basically.\n\n- His investing post history (of only a few months), shows that he\'s invested in hype stocks and consistently told people what to do, pumping those stocks. You\'ll also see a lot of deleted posts. A LOT.\n\n- In an exchange with me yesterday (check his post history), he demonstrated that he doesn\'t even know basic facts (like the fact that all stock is subject to circuit breakers if there is significant volatility).\n\nHere are some other thoughts on the current predicament that he\'s advocating you stay in:\n\nThere is another explanation as to what happened.

I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down.

It was reported to be as high as 80% last week. I saw it as high as 35%. Currently is showing as 11.51% through my broker. Why is this relevant? SI data lags and the borrow rate is the next best real-time indicator of liquidity, in my view. The borrow rate (as I understand it) is typically set by the lender based on how many shares are available to lend out, i.e. there are a larger number of shares to lend out to the shorts today vs. last week. Supply has increased so interest rate to borrow is lower. This to me is a strong sign that share liquidity is high and many short positions have been covered. 11.51% is still significantly high, but should raise a significant question as to whether short squeeze is imminent.\n2. I think swaps have likely occurred in secondary markets which is partly how HFs went under the radar as they exited their positions. Buying ETFs on the secondary market do not show up in the volume of the primary market. There are a number of securities that I believe can be swapped for $GME - $GS2C and the dozens of ETFs that were holding $GME. Check out $XRT and $GAMR - their assets under management (some of those assets were $GME, some were other assets) of dropped by hundreds of millions. $XRT total shares dropped from 8+ million to 2+ million last week. Not sure if $GAMR can be swapped in-kind for the underlying assets but I'm guessing so?

But that was going from $4 to $50 a share.\nEven if GME is not dying, there’s a big difference between being a viable business and being worth $20bn (which is what most people here need it to get to in order to get their money back).  My uncle has a great thriving contracting business - it’s not dying by any means, but there’s no way it’s worth $100m.

It was more investment out of principle than anything else, I wanted to be involved in the situation because I do prefer my markets to be actually free and am a strong believer in 'skin in the game'. Of course, I would've loved to make a quick buck, order a PS5 at GameStop, and donate the rest to a local animal shelter but, alas, so far it was not meant to be. Still, I did learn a lot about mechanisms behind the market I'm usually not exposed to and already got some books to delve deeper into some issues - especially the practices around short selling, FTDs, etc.\n\nNow, regarding my current thinking on GME: I'm still holding my small bag and will ride this rocket to the moon or until its fuel is spent and it comes crashing down. However, I did a bit of my own DD on GME, looked up DFV's old videos on YouTube, and have to agree with your part regarding the fundamentals of the stock. So, once this wild ride is over and the dust settles I'm strongly leaning towards dcaing into a bigger long position on GME, either to get my average down significantly or to build a new position after selling during a potential Big Squeeze Part 2. I do like the plan the company has to turn its business around, it already has good contracts in place, and I am willing to bet the exposure the current situation has brought will have a long-term positive effect on share prices, which will give the company more capital that they can use to accelerate growth. Nostalgia can be a powerful psychological force - be it about the good ol' days of gaming or the company that made you rich in the first place.\n\nThanks for your extensive post!

Hopefully someone can prove me wrong, but a few thoughts I have had regarding the potential squeeze situation:\n\n1. Coinciding with the whole RobinHood bullshit, the price went all the way up to $498, then back down to mid $100s in less than three minutes. During that period shorts also went up to \\~240%, effectively doubling the previous %. So they drive the price up to almost $500, open new shorts, drive price back down to $100s, then close on their original shorts at a loss, but not a death blow, buying themselves some time in the process. Meanwhile, opening new shorts (that do not expire) at that high of a price ($490s - highest its ever been) will allow them to ride this out until the stock returns to HELLA low, pre-reddit frenzy prices, then cover those shorts and make BILLIONS. They can afford to ride it out long term on the non-expiring shorts because, while they will lose millions a day in interest on their borrowed shorts, the potential gains on the new $498 (and potentially higher this week) shorts they opened will FAR outweigh the interest they will have to pay waiting for the price to drop to cover super cheap months down the line from now.\n2. Another potential theory is that every day the price has gone up, the rest of the NASDAQ and DOW/entire market has been down a fair amount. So that could mean they are selling their long positions to raise capital to cover their current shorts (also getting a 2.5bil loan from Daddy Citadel) all while doubling down on the shorts at 498 and making more billions in the process.\n\nEven if they just drive the price down from $350-300/share with millions of shorts out (via short ladders, etc), thats a massive difference that could hold off interest and buy them time. They would be buying time to wait out all of WSB and amateur investors that have less knowledge, resources, and tools than they do. They have wayyyy deeper pockets than we do, so they can afford to wait for this to die off, go back to pre-frenzy prices, then cash out on their new shorts. And I am well aware of everyone with diamond hands, but lets be real. It comes down to a rigged game of HF billionaires that NEVER lose to normal people holding on longer than a bunch of redditors who have thrown a large portion of life savings into the stock. All they have to do is wait for them to get bored or cold feet and cash in, driving price back down, and getting a massive bag on their shorts.

Cohen, had wagered that shares of GameStop, AMC Entertainment (not to be confused with AMCX) and other mall mainstays from the 1990s would fall as their businesses shrank.  Instead, the stocks skyrocketed when amateur investors , coordinating via Reddit, Twitter and other social media sites and determined to bring to light all of the hedgefunds illegal activities, kept buying up and holding shares, propping up their prices, respectively.  That caused Melvin, which had $8 billion in assets under management in January 2021, to lose billions of their investors dollars as it scrambled to cover ALL OF ITS ILLEGALLY SHORTED positions.  It was propped up by a $2.75 billion bailout from the hedge funds Point72, run by Mr. Cohen and Citadel, as well as fresh Capital from new investors to continue their illegal activities.  Before deciding to shutter his fund, Mr. Plotkin had considered turning himself in and whistleblowing.

So in this case, 2020 4th quarter 13Fs are due Feb 15.

So the original DD was folks thinking the stock was way over shorted. We don't know the exact number, but we can safely assume it was over 100% of float a few weeks ago, which means all the institutions sold short under 20. The squeeze was talked about, then the hype and media attention pushed the stock up to 200, 300, then 400 hoping for a short squeeze. Did the squeeze happen? Did those shorts cover? We simply don't know. All the data we have is inaccurate and outdated. I'm seeing different posts every day saying different things. I think best we know based on the evidence is that some of the shorts probably covered, but there wasn't nearly enough volume or liquidity or change in the price for all the shorts to cover.\n\nNew evidence lately seems to indicate that new short positions may have been taken out when it shot up to the highs in the 200-400 range. I mean, why not? Surely it was going to fall back down again. So now, we know there's tons of short positions still open, but we just don't know exactly how many of where they are. However, I think that we can say with high likelihood is that all the shorts were taken out before the surge at <20, and after the hype, at >200.\n\nSo for the last few days the price has been floating steadily right in the middle of this range. We know shorts pay interest and can't hold for long periods of time - they eventually want to cover. As long as the price stays steady in the middle between the <20 shorts and the >200 shorts, they're going to hold. Eventually, the <20 shorts are going to realize the price isn't coming back down, and they're going to buy to cover to cut their loses and stop bleeding. The shorts >200 are eventually going to realize the price isn't going to go any lower, and they're going to buy to cover to capture their profits. All we need to do now is hold in this range and keep the price between the shorts, like a short sandwich, and eventually all those shorts will slowly cover over time, steadily driving the price upwards as a slow pace. This is waiting game now. Don't sell. Just hold on to your shares, and watch it steadily go upwards over time as all the shorts exit. Hold and embrace the short sandwich!"", ""A very valid concern that's been echoed by other commentators elsewhere is that this data from Bloomberg terminal wouldn't be absolutely reliable, since it's largely developed off of older data streams. \n\nI'm also somewhat suspicious of why you reposted this in varying subreddits repeatedly over the last few days.

(not sure if this was already posted didn\'t go through the comments)', 'I follow several real estate investing subs and have been hearing this echoed.  From what I am gathering, the reason Zillow is doing this is to raise comps.  Most houses when listed for sale are priced based on the comps of the houses in your neighborhood.  By buying up several houses within a specific neighborhood, they are driving up the comp prices for future sales.  They will likely be sitting on these properties for a number of years hoping the higher comps drive up the prices of the overall neighborhoods and promote quality driven high value property development in said areas.  It doesn\'t matter to them though, the current borrowing rates are insanely low.  The capital growth on the property (investment) far outweighs the debt incurred by buying up these properties.  It\'s basically a gentrification tactic but on a much broader scale that has less to do with demographics and more to do with property values (they kind of go hand in hand I guess).\n\nAnother ""theory"" I\'m suspecting is that they may be snagging these properties to venture into the property management and rental space.  Once again, driving up the comps in the neighborhoods can mean they could theoretically drive up the rental prices as well.  I don\'t know that Zillow would want to become a mass landlord for single family homes across the US, but what other platform like them is doing that?  That would be a huge opportunity for them (albeit a huge headache also) but if they execute it right it could work. Also, just think in 5 years if rates are back up in let\'s say the 4-5% range and they\'ve bought each property at a 2-3% range, if they go into the personal finance arm and start lending mortgages or selling a mortgage to a lender (kind of like Rocket Mortgage).....they could make a ton of money on the increase in borrowing rates.  They\'re not stupid, they have reasons, none of which are good for the average American but good for their bottom line.\n\nEither way, it\'s **MASSIVELY** detrimental to the average homebuyer and even renter.  Paying over market price is keeping the average buyer out of the market and if they move into rentals it would keep the average renter unable to afford quality housing unless wages rise significantly.  We\'re slowly moving the bar of middle class to being unattainable.  Poverty rates are rapidly rising, COVID exacerbated the wealth gap significantly.  The lingering inflation and rising costs are going to wreak havoc on the economy in the coming years (IMO).  I personally think we will hit a point where everything just becomes too expensive and poverty hits a plateau where business growth and GDP start to decline.  It\'s happened before with the great depression (which ironically was after a huge growth period in the 20\'s (Roaring 20\'s) after....you guessed it, a pandemic - 1918 Spanish flu).  History doesn\'t always repeat itself but it typically rhymes.  This of course doesn\'t happen over night, but I\'m betting within the next 10 years we\'ll start really seeing how much all of this spending and rising costs and wealth disparage is really detrimental to the future.', 'And the boomers will still say millennials can’t buy homes because they’re lazy.\n\nLooks like World Economic Forum really is right.

Zillow and Open door are buying and holding\n\nYou can tell by their revenue that they're pretty much immediately selling these homes.

They also literally say in their 10-K that they rely on quickly turning over houses and clearing out inventory. Housing inventory was $491 MM at the end of 2020, down from $836 MM at the end of 2019. They had fewer than 2,000 homes in inventory at the end of 2020. \n\n2\\. They're making a profit off of doing this\n\nTheir 10-K also shows that they lost **$320 million** from their homes segment in 2020. In their 10-Q for Q2 2021, they say they lost $59 million. \n\n3\\. Institutional buyers are going to turn us all into renters.\n\nWell, according to invitation homes, institutional investors are 20% of the **rental home market**, which is a fraction of the total home market. All said, institutions own something like 2-4% of single family homes. \n\nFinally, also available in Zillow's public investor presentations: they currently lose about 2% per house. They're expecting to drive down operating costs (i.e., transaction costs) and make 4-5% in the future. The current losses are a cost of tuning algorithms to the point where they can actually make money off of this. \n\nAll of this information is public, and online."", 'ITT: people who don\'t understand that buyers like Zillow represent a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the residential real estate market and that they can\'t just overpay to manipulate the market\n\nConsider that Zillow is spending about $2 billion on residential real estate per year, and the entire residential real estate market in the US is about $2 trillion per year. Zillow doesn\'t even hit 0.1% of it. They\'re not manipulating anything.\n\nAlso consider that mortgage companies appraise homes and will not overlend to buyers in excess of their appraisal. If Zillow pays $50k extra for a house, which is subsequently appraised 50k lower, then they can only sell it in a total-cash offer for the inflated price (or to a buyer who can bring that 50k as cash to the table in addition to a down payment, closing costs, etc).

I almost lost my life once in a car accident. Was extremely lucky and survived, though badly injured. Not religious, but I really had more than one angel looking after me that day. I fully recovered, but I needed almost one year to walk again properly.\n\nThe first day in the hospital when I got conscious, my mind was filled with regrets over time I'd wasted (because at that point, I did not know whether I would recover). Not a single one of these was about money I wasted or didn't make when I had the opportunity to. All of them were about people and how I'd spent my life time so far,  e.g. about times when I did not go out or on trips with my friends because I was too lazy and made up stupid excuses, being too busy to not visit my parents when it would have made them happy, taking time and enjoying the simple things in life because of chasing money, career etc, you get the idea.\n\nThe most remarkable memory from that time is the experience of being able to walk, self-sufficient and independently without help, on my own legs (with crutches but still) to the bathroom in the morning to have a pee, instead of peeing in a bottle handed by a nurse.

A feeling of freedom and exuberance, like the world opened up for me again and the sky is the limit.\n\nSadly, humans tend to overlook and forget these things and  spend too much time on chasing shiny objects, money, fame, whatever, or despair about the absence thereof. I'm not free of that and very few people I know are.  But whenever I get to the point when this makes me miserable, I remind myself of the fact that every day I am able to go to the bathroom in the morning to relieve myself and have a pee without anybody's assistance is a fucking great day! Would it be nicer to be able to do so and have 1 million dollars? Sure, but if I'd have to choose between the two, I'd choose the first. I'd have to think not a second about it.

He was an isolated type of human being. He was highly individualistic and chose to grow into a confirmed “shut-in” and unsociable sort of person. \n2.  As a child, life had been made too easy for him. He bitterly resented thwarting. He always expected to win; he was a very poor loser. \n3.  He never acquired a philosophic technique for meeting disappointment. Instead of accepting disappointments as a regular and commonplace feature of human existence, he unfailingly resorted to the practice of blaming someone in particular, or his associates as a group, for all his personal difficulties and disappointments. \n4.  He was given to holding grudges; he was always entertaining the idea of revenge. \n5.  He did not like to face facts frankly; he was dishonest in his attitude toward life situations. \n6.  He disliked to discuss his personal problems with his immediate associates; he refused to talk over his difficulties with his real friends and those who truly loved him. In all the years of their association he never once went to the Master with a purely personal problem. \n7.  He never learned that the real rewards for noble living are, after all, spiritual prizes, which are not always distributed during this one short life in the flesh. \n\n As a result of his persistent isolation of personality, his griefs multiplied, his sorrows increased, his anxieties augmented, and his despair deepened almost beyond endurance.\n\nWhile this self-centered and ultraindividualistic apostle had many psychic, emotional, and spiritual troubles, his main difficulties were: In personality, he was isolated. In mind, he was suspicious and vengeful. In temperament, he was surly and vindictive. Emotionally, he was loveless and unforgiving. Socially, he was unconfiding and almost wholly self-contained. In spirit, he became arrogant and selfishly ambitious. In life, he ignored those who loved him, and in death, he was friendless.\n\nThese, then, are the factors of mind and influences of evil which, taken altogether, explain why a well-meaning and otherwise onetime sincere believer in Jesus, even after several years of intimate association with his transforming personality, forsook his fellows, repudiated a sacred cause, renounced his holy calling, and betrayed his divine Master.  \n\n\nUrantia Book', 'OP please add at the end of your post for someone who may be in need https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ perhaps he phone number also.', 'I’ve seen a few of these posts this year unfortunately.

They have not disallowed tracking on their own App Store and within the iOS platform. \nFacebook played this so badly too. \n\nI’ve spent actually HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars on FB ad spend (I’m a small fish too). Since April of last year, ad inventory has gotten like 5x more expensive. Ads on Facebook get inflated by a lot of factors but the one affecting CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) was VC funded companies that sell things nobody wants. The next was the election. Even with all the sophisticated tracking - people would comment “is Facebook reading my mind?” on our ads every day - ads have already been getting way too expensive. Our performance on ads is unusually good. Still, Facebook has steadily raised the price of ad space. They want you to give them every profit dollar knowing you’ll continue to pay for break-even “customer acquisition.” They even say that in their literature  to ad buyers. I’ll search for that link. \n\nThis is actually the perfect smokescreen for Facebook to say, “see it’s apple hurting your business.” Facebook serves a warning on the ad console saying something to that effect. Except Facebook sets the CPMs!! This is not some perfect market where there is no centralized influence. Facebook warns me “your ads will be less effective because of... reasons.” You know what would make ads more effective? LOWER THE COST OF YOUR INCREASINGLY INEFFECTIVE AD SPACE! The iOS14 stuff could not have come at a better time for them. \n\nI don’t know why Apple is doing this. Maybe to sell more iPhones? Honestly that seems like the naïve explanation. I’m sure it’s something more nefarious. I promise they do not have your best interest in mind. \n\nYou are still going to get ads guys. They will simply be less targeted. Is that good? I don’t know. If anything the day has been won by VC funded zombies -that only look like businesses but whose charge is to sell their equity not their product. Because they don’t care if produce a profit on ads. They don’t care is they ever generate a financial profit. So they spend on ads regardless of return just to drive their topline.

The 2008 financial crisis was in part solved by the federal government purchasing dying assets and securities like MBS by selling US Treasuries to the Fed to create liquidity. This isn’t tax payer money, it’s basically a money printer. Also, since 2008, that federal investment of low grade securities as well as the conservatorship of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae resulted in the government turning a profit of 8 billion USD by 2018. So no, taxpayers never have bailed out the banking industry.\n\nAlso, the largest banks were responsible for the 2008 crash, and the relationship they shared with hedge funds was totally separated after the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Section 619, so effectively hedge funds are just private money managers.', ""Coz he became a billionaire.

Already 5 states passed this \n\nTo jointcommittee.publichealth@malegislature.gov\n\nAug 6 at 8:06 PM\n\nPlease reconsider mandated vaccines for the goal of increasing the quality of care for vulnerable children. It reduces their chances of being treated, as we have seen time and time again, most notably with the Covid vaccine, people who do not believe in the vaccine will not just give or take it for themselves and their children, they would get fired and lose their income. Initially, the idea of threatening people into submission seems like a good idea to someone who is not in touch with reality however there are severe consequences including adverse reaction reports being inaccurate, and loss of trust between patient/parent and providers/government.\xa0\n\nAdditionally, risks of lawsuits for providers, nurses, and government systems because it puts kids in danger of adverse reactions that their parents will not be able to communicate with acute care staff in case of emergency. Kids do not know their allergies and some are unknown. More parents would be treating and bringing their children to hospitals, as it is likely offices are closed or on weekends, as these things often happen this way, and risk iatrogenic complications in addition to not being treated accurately for that condition. You likely assumed all medical records would be connected and this would not be a risk, however, you are very wrong in that assumption. Caregivers need to know what their legal guardianship responsible parties were given at health care offices. Lack of this information could lead to iv antibiotics for fevers and seizures as you must know, this causes reactions but is not limited to antibiotic resistance, c-diff, and other avoidable events. In that scenario...who is responsible. The acute care staff, the parents, the doctor, the nurse who administered the vaccine of the public identity responsible for encouraging sneaky medical practices?\n\nResponsibility of who gave the vaccine in the above situation legally.\n\nRemoving religious and medical exemptions, and allowing vaccines to be given without parental input puts vulnerable children at increased risk of losing out on health care and school because it's unlikely someone with a strong moral belief system will just agree to do what you want by force and threats. Unfortunately substituting medical practice as one of patient-centered care with a voting and equal parent and provider interaction to a dictating doctor-knows-best mentality will ruin trust. Ultimately the government would be responsible for children's health, lack thereof, as well as lack of education in these circumstances.\n\nGenerally speaking, options are better than demands. There will always be some people who choose things that others view as stupid, however removing choice implies most people are dumb and require the government to act as parents. Or government agencies want more power than the Constitution gives them and are going about it by sneaking around and making policies without a public vote. You are dismissing the fundamental principle people need to trust their government and providers as irrelevant. It is not irrelevant and your proposal is dangerous and inconsiderate.\n\nThank you\xa0\n\nShauna KO\n\nMother of 3 fully vaccinated, beautiful children.

It’s all about being at the right place at the right time. That would be an inelegant way to phrase it so I figured I would tell an anecdote that draws directly from my personal experience.\n\nWhen I was fresh out of college, I decided I would become a stockbroker. I got my series 7 and proceeded to cold call whales and pitch them. In my spare time, I would invest in stocks. During my tenure on Wall Street, I would start becoming more and more knowledgeable about investing. However, my increased awareness of the financial markets didn’t serve me as I would proceed to lose about $5,000 making poor investment choices betting on Freddie Mac during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nYears later, in a completely different profession, I would decide to invest in the EV sector on a whim because I saw the need for autonomous driving and alternative energy in my daily life. I didn’t know this at the time, but this one singular decision would turn my family into millionaires pretty much overnight (under a year).\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is I probably wouldn’t have pulled the trigger on the EV bet had I not been educated deeply in the market years prior. However, even though I had the know how back then, the timing of the market was not right for me and I ended up losing money. \n\nPicking the right stock that will drastically change your future relies on a combination of factors:\n\n1. Having a deep understanding of markets and investor psychology.\n\n2. Recognizing trends and society needs before they are fully developed. \n\n3. Betting big enough on the right players in the aforementioned trend to make a difference in your life.\n\nYou don’t go around picking stocks that show massive gains at any point in time. Any person who claims they can do this is a liar. You kind of have to wait for the right opportunities and be really educated about the sector and investing in general when the opportunities come. It’s like when preparation and luck intersect at a juncture of your life and then you need the courage to bet big.\n\nTL;DR: You can’t go around trying to force a situation or a stock to be a winner, it’s about the ebb and flow of the current market and then your prowess in identifying these opportunites/trends.

But there are a few things you can look at to help. For beginners, the first thing you should learn is why stocks go up or down.\n\nAt a VERY BASIC level, you need to understand the 3 reasons stocks go up/down.\n\nStocks go up when\n1) people want (buy) a stock\n2) the company is doing well\n3) pure entropy \n\nStocks go down when\n1) people don't want (sell) the stock\n2) the company is doing poorly\n3) pure entropy\n\n**#1** for both is based on *perception*. Thinking a company or stock is good or bad will drive people to want it or discard it. That doesn't mean that the company is actually performing well (look at Tesla). This is all about image. This is why a CEO's tweets can increase or decrease the value. \n\n**#2** Is based on *actual performance*. If you want to be a safe investor, you should focus on this. When a company makes a lot of money, stocks tend to go up. When a company does poorly, it tends to go down. Quarterly earnings reports/forecasts, and yearly balance sheets (form 10-K and 10-Q) will help determine this. \n\n**#3** is the understanding that stocks can do *whatever they want*. Sometimes it's rational, sometimes not. You have to be okay with this before investing anything.\n\nThis all said, people that find stocks that explode tend to think that the stock they are investing in is SEVERELY undervalued. Sometimes doing your research (look at point 2) will prove it, but most of the time this is a guess at best."", ""In the big crash in March I started reading the financial statements of companies I was interested in.\n\nI found this energy company called Infigen (mostly wind turbines) that had fallen exactly in line with the market, but when I read their statements they had already sold almost all of their production until the end of 2022, so it didn't seem logical that their share price would have dropped so much due to the pandemic given they were unlikely to see any effects at least in the next 2 years.\n\nI bought in and within 2 months there was an offer to take the company private at double the price I had paid.

In much the same way that McDonald's is a real estate company, or Starbucks is arguably a bank, Tesla is much more than just a car company. Yes Tesla produces cars and is working to position themselves as the GM of the 21st century. [By 2028 the electric car market is expected to be worth around $1.3 Trillion](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/06/2291730/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-Market-Size-Is-Anticipated-to-Grow-USD-1-318-22-Billion-in-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-24-3.html).

Tesla is already [building supercharging stations nationwide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-open-its-chargers-to-other-electric-vehicles.html). They are positioning themselves to be the largest utility charging station for EVs in the Western Hemisphere with the capability to charge all electric vehicles, not just their own. This presents multiple profit opportunities itself. Not only do they make money selling electricity, but they will also serve as a hospitality and retail company for consumers who have to wait around 15+ minutes while their vehicles charge. Tesla is also working to [decentralize electric utility grids](https://insideevs.com/features/537228/tesla-threaten-worlds-top-utilities/) through their developments in solar and battery tech. This allows both residential and commercial consumers the ability to generate, store, and sell their own electrical energy reserves. Outside of the US they are partnering with big energy players such as Australia's Neoen and Germany's Octopus Energy to enter the public utility market. Inside the US Tesla is undergoing the process to be [licensed as a public utility company](https://chargedevs.com/newswire/tesla-could-become-a-major-power-retailer-in-texas/). \n\n\n   \n\n\n\nDid you know that [Tesla is becoming an insurance company](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/tesla-insurance/)?

Tesla is also a software company. Think about how valuable the ridesharing market is. Tesla is one of the company's at the forefront of developing the autonomous driving software necessary to make ridesharing truly profitable long term. They are developing software for each arm of everything they dabble in. For example they are developing the smart software for electric utilities that will automatically buy and sell electricity around the grid in the most efficient manner possible in real time. They are building one the largest IOT networks in the world all connected through proprietary software. Under the Musk's larger umbrella of companies, this will conveniently pair well with Space X's internet service. Tesla is also a major subscription service company. Everything associated with their name has the potential to be thrown under some kind of subscription plan. You want faster tier charging at their stations? Just upgrade your plan. Want access to Wifi / entertainment while you wait at a charging station? Sure just upgrade to this membership plan. You want to utilize the new stage 4 / stage 5 autonomous driving capabilities? Just buy this subscription plan. Want priority transportation when using their ridesharing service? Sure thing, just upgrade your membership first. As if that's not enough, Tesla like any other technology company is surely collecting every bit of data they possibly can from anyone and everything that in any way interacts with their IOT network. That data is another product that can be packaged and sold. So I'm not going to argue that they are worth $1.2 Trillion. However I will say that when you take into account the financial reserves they have, the economic shifts predicted for the near future, and the way in which Tesla is setting themselves up to be the first large player to take advantage of this changes, then that valuation is probably not too far off from where it should be.

(Yes, some vehicles are built 100% by a company other than the brand whose badge they bear - and not just the internal badge engineering we see from the big three) The fact that Panasonic builds Tesla batteries in dedicated plants in the US is notable, but still small potatoes compared to nearly every other brand. \n\n\nTraditional carmakers are really no comparison for this company, or any other new manufacturers that take on the insourcing model. Especially as some have begin to open-source some of the IP, the key benefits of sub-manufacturing diminish. Meanwhile, the outgoing heavy-hitters are locked in a death-struggle between unions, suppliers and dealers all refusing to give up their piece, which results in much slower progress and innovation in almost every facet of the business.\n\nThese are just a few of the reasons speculation is more justified than first meets the eye. A trillion? Maybe not, but Tesla has just crossed over the break even point in 2019 and is ready to pass Ford in net income with a mere fraction of the volume. Right now their only limiter on profit is how fast they can produce more vehicles.', 'OP, there were some wise words I was graced a long time ago.  \n\n“The stock market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.” - John Maynard Keynes', 'Yeah all true.

Maybe like 10 different cities, tops. Even if they actually did experiment with let\'s say an order of magnitude higher # of cities, Tesla gets millions of miles worth of driving data across almost every single place in the US every month. \n\n(2) reaching that stage 4/5 self driving requires a lot of precomputation - they essentially need to have 3D meshes/maps of all the roads they travel on, before Waymo can operate.

Also breaking a fiduciary duty which should get them sued. \n\nSince WE (the retail investors) cannot act in a way to prevent brokers from breaking their duties to us. The role of the government comes into play.\n\nThe GOVERNMENT has a social contract with its citizens to maintain social order. This is done by creating prohibitions (laws) for breaking contracts & making requirements of truth-telling (laws requiring transparency). \n\nThe SEC is the arm of govt that is responsible for maintaining the social order for this particular issue. \n\nJust my personal opinion but I don't have faith in the SEC to keep up their social contract in this matter. \n\nIs there anything to be done if the SEC (acting as the government) fails its citizens?\n\nYes, but its not always pretty. We, as citizens, obey the laws and regulations of the government in return for protection. If the SEC fails to deliver meaningful change to prevent brokers from continuing this practice, the government broke its social contract with its citizens. \n\n!!!\nThe repercussions: citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including protests and, when necessary, violence. \n!!!\n\n\nI'm not sure how many people were affected enough by it to try to do anything. But when officers acting on behalf of the government broke the social contract to protect the life and property of its people, like strangling a defenseless, cuffed face-down in the street citizen... \n\nRiots broke out EVERYWHERE and even a couple insurrections made autonomous zones. \n\nI fear that retail investors won't be able to enact change since the government is so incompetent regarding tech and the stock market. And I'm not entirely convinced the SEC doesn't have ties to major financial institutions which is a conflict of interest ."", ""It's a good explanation, but misses some key points. The main one is that--even if short interest should be reported better, and there should be rules about increasing margin--IB, RH and others were running their business in a way that would have created the meltdown he is warning of, and if they had run their businesses differently the risk of a meltdown would have been eliminated. There is nothing forcing IB to allow that much short interest on low margin, and they are a big enough broker that they have a damn good idea of how much short interest is out there without the SEC telling them. So, yes, he is right that there is a hole in the system but brokers are exploiting it as much as traders, big and small, because they are essentially loaning out money without a care about whether it can actually be paid back.

At the same time, GME has 50M registered short shares outstanding, and a short interest of 70M shares.  In addition, there were about 1.5M calls, which would call for 150M shares. ...If the longs repay their margin loans and exercise the calls, their brokers would have been obligated by the rules, as they are today, to deliver to them 270 million shares while only 50 million shares existed.  So when the shorts cannot deliver the shares, the broker representing the longs must, must, by the rules of the system, go into the market and buy the shares at any price, pushing the price into the thousands.  So as the price goes higher, the shorts default on the brokers, and the brokers now must cover themselves.  That would push the price further up.""\n\n270M shares shorted, when only 50M shares exist.  THAT IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL.

In the ensuing two-hour conversation about technology and business, Jobs proposed the founding of a computer company led by him and Wozniak. Those two would each hold a 45% stake so that Wayne could receive a 10% stake to act as a tie-breaker in their decisions.[8] As the venture\'s self-described ""adult in the room""[6][9] at age 41, Wayne wrote a partnership agreement, and the three founded Apple Computer on April 1, 1976. Wayne illustrated the first Apple logo[10] and wrote the Apple I manual.[6][9][11]\n\n>Wayne\'s business attitude was already risk-averse due to his experience five years prior with the ""very traumatic"" failure of his slot machine business, the debt of which he had spent one year voluntarily repaying.[6][9] Jobs secured a US$15,000 line of credit to buy product materials for Apple\'s first order which had been placed by The Byte Shop, whose reputation as a notoriously slow-paying vendor gave Wayne great concern for his future.[6][8] Legally, all members of a partnership are personally responsible for any debts incurred by any partner; unlike Jobs and Wozniak, then 21 and 25, Wayne had personal assets that potential creditors could possibly seize\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Wayne\n\n\nThis man still got no pussy.

Call the investor relations for the company.  It is usually listed on the certificate, although they can change.  They are responsible for accounting of every outstanding share, and who owns it.  There should be a CUSIP number on the certificate that will help identify it.  They can tell you if it’s a duplicate (like they lost it along the way and had a replacement sent). \n2.  If the shares are actually owned by them (the certificate is legit) I would advise retaining an attorney and getting a good accountant at this point.  If you are the sole heir, and the estate is open still, it may be very wise to have the shares (maybe not all) cashed in by the estate.  This would establish a date of death (dod) valuation for the shares, and the estate would be liable for some taxes.  Depending on the total value of the estate, you may be able to inherit the balance “tax free”, making you only responsible for the gains since the DOD.  \n3.  Plan your investment strategy.  I would STRONGLY recommend that if you are not familiar with handling this amount of money, you seek out wise counsel.  I can’t tell you what that means for you, but it certainly isn’t following subreddits blindly into the abyss.  \n\nBest to you.\n\nThere is no substitute for a good accountant and a good attorney, one should have both employed.', 'That’s worth over $250,000 USD', 'My grandparents left me jigsaw puzzles.....\n\nedit: I am just being cheeky, by the way. My grandparents were great people, and I treasure the short time I had with them, and value that over any financial or material possessions.', ""Finally, something I can help with.\n\nOP, I work for a Stock Transfer Agent, not the agent for Meredith, but I can steer you in the right direction.\n\nFirst, you can't assume that the stock certificate is worth anything at this point. You MUST contact the Stock Transfer Agent for Meredith. That is Equiniti:  800-468-9716. Any time a physical stock certificate is issued it is no longer listed on the records of a broker and instead is listed on the Transfer Agents records. So there is no need to contact a broker first.\n\nYou will need some info before calling Equiniti. First, see if you have any old statements kept with the certificate. These will list the account number at Equiniti. Also, whoever is the first name on the certificate, you will need their social security number as well. \n\nYou will need to explain to the Customer Service Rep (CSR) that your Grandparents are deceased and you found a stock certificate among the possessions that they left for you in their will. The CSR will ask you if you know your Grandparent's account number (from a statement) and if not, the social security number of the first name listed on the stock. Thankfully you've already done that legwork. Next they will ask you to pass a verification check. This will include tell them exactly how the account is registered (the names on the stock certificate), the mailing address (most likely the last address your Grandparents lived at) and the last 4 digits of the shareholder's social security number (if you haven't provided the ss# to locate the account). They will also ask for your name and a telephone number for you. All Transfer Agents should capture this information on every call. \n\nOnce you've passed the verification, you can ask the CSR if the certificate is still a valid certificate. They will ask you for the certificate number, which is usually in the upper left hand corner of the certificate. It may include letters and numbers. They will also ask how many shares and when it was issued. With those three pieces of information they can tell if the certificate was previously claimed as lost and replaced (no longer valid) or if it is a valid live certificate.\n\nThe CSR will most likely not be able to verify anything else for you over the phone because you cannot prove over the phone that you are the legal heir to the shares. You cannot sell the shares at this time, you cannot change the address, or anything else. We treat you as a third party, not the owner of the stock for security purposes. So they won't tell you the current balance or anything like that. Sorry.\n\nTo obtain a current statement and change the address the CSR will most likely advise you to submit a letter in writing along with a certified copy of the court appointment naming you as executor of your Grandparent's estate, dated within 60 days, asking to change the address to your's. Unfortunately, since you are a third party, everything must be done in writing. Again, it is our job to safeguard the owner's account and you cannot prove you are the owner over the phone.\n\nOnce you have a current statement and have the address changed, and if the certificate is valid, you have a couple options. 1. Take it to a brokerage firm. They can deposit the certificate into an account. You will most likely need to provide them with the same legal documents you provided Equiniti. 2. You can transfer the shares into an estate account (if there are multiple heirs) or an account in your name. I'm not familiar with Equiniti's transfer process but you will most likely need to fill out Transfer Forms, obtain a Medallion Stamp from a bank or brokerage firm, and possible provide another certified copy of the court appointment. You will also need to mail them the original stock certificate. My company recommends sending the certificate trackable mail and insured for 3% of the value of the stock as this is the cost to replace it if lost.\n\nOnce the shares are in your name, whether at the broker or transfer agent, they are yours to do with as you please. \n\nNow, I will say, there is a very good chance that the certificate was claimed as lost and replaced already. There is also a very good chance that the company had no contact from your Grandparents in over 3 years and sent the shares to your state's Unclaimed Property Office. This is called escheatment. \n\nI also wouldn't get too excited about stock splits that everyone else is hyping. When a stock splits the shares are either issued in a new certificate or held electronically at the Transfer Agent. So your Grandparents may have cashed those in a long time ago. I also wouldn't get excited about dividends. The fact that you didn't mention that you received any quarterly checks from the company at your Grandparent's address has me feeling the shares are escheated or already cashed.\n\nThis is pretty exciting though and it's worth the effort to chase them down. I wish my company was the Transfer Agent because then I could look it up in a few seconds and give you the good or bad news.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me, and fingers crossed you hit the jackpot!"", 'What happens to the dividend?', ""Don't get ahead of yourself. Odds are they were in the estate and disbursed. Paper stock certificates are basically worthless if there's nothing attached. Protect that paper nonetheless but don't get your hopes up."", 'Would like an update on this once you get it figured out', 'To actually answer your question: work with a broker. Their physical securities department will help process the paper certificates to book entry. From there you can hold or sell. Source: am financial advisor.', 'Imagine finding .1% of a billion dollar company inside an old desk....', 'Hi OP, I actually do this for a living so I want to give you some steps to help you look into this. A lot of people are really excited for you, however what they don\'t know is that just because you have a paper stock certificate doesn\'t mean it\'s worth anything - it\'s possible the original holder thought they lost it, reported it as lost to their broker or the transfer agent and was able to still redeem the certificate. Yes, that can happen, just because a certificate is lost doesn\'t mean the original holder can\'t still get their shares. Until you have at least confirmed the certificate is valid, there\'s not any point in celebrating.\n\nYou have two options here - the first is you can redeem them with your broker, the second is to redeem them directly with the transfer agent. Usually a broker is going to charge you a fee, but the process is a lot easier. If there\'s someone you are already working with your best bet may be to go to them. The broker will provide instructions to you on what paperwork they need to get this done for you.\n\nThe ""manual"" way is to redeem it with the transfer agent. Here are some general instructions to set you on this path:\n\nIf you go to the Meredith Co Investor Relations website and scroll down, you will see the transfer agent listed as EQ Shareowner Services. I am not going to put a website or contact information in this message, because I think it\'s important you do this yourself. Call them & report the death of your grandfather, and speak with someone about whether certificate itself is still valid. If it is, you have completed the first part of this journey. EQ should provide some instructions to you on how you actually need to redeem the stock certificate, and the documents they require may depend on how the shares were held. If it\'s under your grandfather\'s sole name, it\'s possible that EQ may ask you to provide documents for the Estate of your grandfather. Are you the executor of the estate, or are you in contact with them? They may need to be the ones to work with EQ.\n\nOften times for situations like this, the transfer agent may ask that the executor either open up a new account directly with EQ in the name of the estate, or that the Executor provide a written letter of instruction to instruct that an account be opened up for a beneficiary. In both cases, the new account holders will have to complete new account paperwork. This new account will be established to receive the shares from the deceased individual, and will hold book-entry shares - basically electronic shares. Often times this happens because companies don\'t like liquidating things under deceased individuals SSN\'s - the IRS doesn\'t like seeing activity under social\'s that are assigned to deceased individuals, so any liquidation will most likely need to happen under the EIN of the Estate, or the SSN of a beneficiary.\n\nOnce the new account is established and all the paperwork provided, then you can work with EQ to liquidate under the new account or to transfer the shares if you don\'t wish to liquidate. EQ will be your best friend for every stage of this process.\n\nFinal bit of advice - if you end up sending the paper certificate to anyone overnight, please  insure it. You may not need to insure it for the full amount, as like I stated before lost certificates can  still be redeemed, however redeeming a lost certificate often requires you to pay 3-5% of the underlying value of the certificate. Def throw some insurance on any original packages you send through the mail.\n\nEdit : also make copies of anything you send out', 'Hold up.  You didnt find cash.  And it is not in your name.  \n\nFirst, the certificate may have been cancelled and would be worthless. If it had been lost and your grandparents had it replaced, it is wall paper.\n\nSecond, as it is not in your name, you are going to have to get it registered in whoever inherited it, probably ALl of your grandparents children.  If one or more are already dead thst is a problem.\n\nThe bottom line is it is like finding a check made out to someonr else.  Your brokerage firm will NOT under any circumstances let you deposit a certificate made out to anyone other than the exact name(s) on your account.\n\nYou have a long road ahead in re-registering the certificate.  Maybe it is all yours and maybe not.\n\nOn the splits, they may be held at the registrar for the company.  Or they were paid out when your grandparents died.

It was a relatively simple but lengthy process. The biggest hurdle will be proving ownership however. I imagine the stock certificate is in your grandfather's name and you need to prove that your are the inheritor and executor of his estate through the courts. If you are named the executor of the estate then you can begin the process of converting that stock certificate into actual shares in a brokerage account. This process is done via any brokerage like Charles Schwab, J.P. Morgan, etc. I used Vanguard because I already have an account with them. I had to open a new brokerage account owned by my father's estate and then get the shares added to the account. Once the shares were reflected in my dad's estate's brokerage account, I was able to sell them as an executor and the money went into my dad's estate's bank account which is owned and operated by my siblings and I as the inheritors of his estate.

From Newsweek \n\nI have no doubt that was the intention, I deal with the same issue with my nieces that I am guardian for.  I would not have allowed them to join in with 650 other girls to audition for these parts.

In an interview with [Screen Daily,](https://www.screendaily.com/features/director-maimouna-doucoure-reveals-the-shocking-inspiration-behind-sundance-drama-cuties/5146481.article) the director explained that the inspiration came from seeing young girls perform in a sexually suggestive fashion.

I asked myself if these young girls understood what they were doing,"" she said.

Did she ask herself if those girls understood what they were doing in the auditions?  In her film? \n\nI cancelled Netflix not because I thought Doucouré was trying to slip cp past everybody, but because she holds up her (valid) critique on the sexualization of women while standing on the backs of the 650 little girls that likely watched and learned how to dance like this in competition for a spot in her movie.

Petco management is increasing its focus on services as the future for the company. Store remodels and the introduction of veterinary, grooming, and boarding services align with this approach. Although there is competition, few provide the full range of services.\n\n**Pricing:**\n\nPetco recently completed its IPO. The IPO priced at $18 and quickly shot to the $30 range. Like many IPO offerings the stock has stabilized its base price subsequent to the initial IPO frenzy and is a bargain in the $20 - $24 range. Current analyst estimates range from $25 to $32, a potentially quick 50% upside from the current price.\n\n**Opportunity:**\n\nEven with the impact of Covid on many business sectors, Pet industry expenditures topped $99 billion in 2020 representing growth of $1.5 billion for the year. Forecasts predict that by 2027 the global pet care market will reach $350 billion. Other competitors have experienced 5x growth in stock prices since their IPOs.

For reference, the Vanguard S&P 500 index debuted in 1976. \n\nArthur Lipper petitioned the SEC to start an index tracking the DJIA way back in 1968 or '69, but it never got off the ground. The idea of index funds had been floating around for a few years at this point based on Eugene Fama's research from the University of Chicago, and had been boosted by Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (among others) who said the typical mutual fund in the 1960s was a ripoff and people would be better served with passive management tracking an average market return. \n\nJeremy Grantham started an index fund for the public a few years later (1971) but it was such a radical idea he didn't have any customers for a while, not until 1973 or '74. Also starting in 1971, John McQuown managed part of a pension with an index fund while he worked at a Wells Fargo branch in San Fransisco. \n\nRex Sinquefield tracked the S&P 500 at a Chicago bank starting in 1973, open to the general public, and had billions of dollars under management after a few years. Sinquefild and McQuown both went on to work at Dimenaional Fund Advisors, started by U of Chicago alumni, whose oldest fund dates to 1981. \n\nSo while Boggle certainly desrves a lot of credit for promoting index funds, he simply did not invent them nor was he the first to sell them. the last time I checked, Dimensional Funds was still a top-10 American firm by assets under management. but they're not as well know as other firms, always done little or no advertising/promotion, preferring to let like-minded clients find them rather than seek them out. \n\nFor sources see Justin Fox's The Myth of the Rational Market, and this: https://www.stlmag.com/The-Return-of-the-King/\n\ngreat list, BTW.

It was only after passing that and getting into the field that I realized oh, most of these idiots I work with just took it because they had to, and retained nothing. \n\nOnce you learn the mechanics of how markets work and a broad overview of regulation you realize literally everything is stacked again the retail investor (under the guise of “protection”) but you learn how the sausage is made in terms of market makers, call/put strategies, the main points of fundamental and technical analysis, Fed policy/theory 101 etc. I repeatedly go back to my online 7 manual (especially in light of the egregious market manipulation by RH) and it’s super helpful. Now when I read other investing books I have the foundation to understand them. Kinda like learning the alphabet before you learnt to read. Having the series 7 makes me a much better investor for myself but you don’t need to take the test (you’d need a FINRA firm sponsor anyway) to learn a shit ton from the prep course. \n\nThe $200 or so bux I spent on the course was worth it.

It\'s a great overview of the public mindset around each of these, and how pretty much every time there was a genuine belief of ""this time is different"".\n\nThe two of these really helped me stay grounded and realistic, not fall for pattern seeking where they don\'t exist and not panic or get greedy from fomo.\n\nI\'d really recommend anyone to read them whatever they believe about the stock market.

"Would like to take my business elsewhere since RH wants to cater to Wall Street, suggestions for a new go to Brokerage app/site?","['Fidelity. Here\'s how to transfer - this post was removed by the mods in w.s.b, and I don\'t know why:\n\n# Transferring from RH to Fidelity\n\nThis process is actually very simple. Earlier, I used to move ""mature"" positions from RH to Fidelity. I moved all my positions today. This is how I did this:\n\n1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.\n2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.\n3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.\n4. Click on ""Start a transfer""\n5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.\n6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select ""individual"" in the account type.\n7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account. Like I mentioned above, earlier I used to transfer single equities, but today, I selected ""entire account"".\n8. I know that this works as I have transferred other accounts into Fidelity in the past without an issue (once I had an incorrect cost-basis, but that was taken care of with a phone call).\n9. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.\n10. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it\'s the next tax filing season.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow! This blew up! Thank you for your comments and I\'ll try to summarize my feedback in a few bullets:\n\n* Some people have asked if we can do this with other institutions. You can select the institution in step #5. Personally, I have transferred from RH and E-trade.\n* After the transfer, please confirm that the cost basis is correct. Call Fidelity if there\'s an error.\n* If you have a company 401k account in Fidelity, just call them and they\'ll open a trading account for you. Also a Roth IRA if you\'re interested. Their funds have some of the lowest costs. \n* Also, most cities have a Fidelity brick & mortar office. Take an appointment and go do your thing in person.\n* In the past I\'ve transferred from Schwab into Empower and back again into Schwab - the process just works, and this is allowed by SEC. It is called ""Transfer of Asset"" for a reason.\n*', ""Fidelity is the only one that no one has complained about\n\nEdit: maybe their customer service suck, so that why people don't use them so they still have GME shares for people to buy.

"I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.","['And you started with? 600k?', ""great post but an important question seems how much you started with?  \nIt's quite different if you made 500k starting with 100k or 1M."", 'Let me summarize.\n\n1. You had capital.\n2. Encountered a pandemic.', "">I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, \n\nWhat is your starting point. How much did you compound in the last 3 years (CAGR) what is you maximum downturm? \n\n\n\n>Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market.\n\nIf you have ever been in a bear market, you know that good earning reports can spiral down stocks. \n\n\n>In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back. It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nThis is plain wrong. The market fluctuations and volume between earnings is not higher than those during earnings. If you look at individual stocks volume actually often increases or decreases around the earnings date (of course it does). Professional Asset managers also don't rebalance their portfolios depending on when earnings hit, but often at the end of the quarter or after digesting the latest earnings report (that is why the biggest stock moves are often around earnings). \n\n>I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season.\n\nGood luck with that in the future. Nobody can anticipate when they are coming. \n\nTake Advantage of Sector Rotations\n\n>The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. \n\nThat is just not true. If you look at sector rotations, these can often take years to play out. Oil was in a decade long bear market. How can you easily predict the turning point? Professional investors also often sell off sectors that have performed poorly and buy overperforming sectors (oil in favor of tech for example in 2019). \n\n\n\n>Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt.\n\nThis is just wrong. Look at oil, gold miners etc.... it might be, but it might not. \n\n\n>One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\nThat strategy works in a bull market until it doesn't. Tread carefully this is quite risky. \n\n\n\n\n>My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. \n\nThose tools are available to everyone and will not guranteee outperformance. \n\n\n>Be Wary of Analyst Opinions\n\nAgree\n\nEDIT: Also you risk/reward ratio is mathematically not good.

When traders watch too many things they can get lost in a maze of over choice and conflicting signals, indicators, advice.

Don't be fooled. This IS The Market Crash: My DD.,"['Who replaces those lost tenants?\n\nSpirit Halloween. That’s who.', '[deleted]', 'I disagree.\n\nWe are in a bull market and have been since 2010 not February, this bull market is being driven by the fed and interest rates. This isnt a ""dot com/tech bubble"" its a ""fed interest rate bubble"" and that bubble won\'t pop until the fed gives up on preserving interest rates and inflation. \n\nWhat just happened is actually easy to explain and understand when you look at the big picture (attached at the bottom). The Nasdaq and all these major indexes just hit all time record highes at a record pace. The ascent was so fast a violent pull back was due and thats what we got. But we are still in a fed bull market and the Nasdaq with its major tech indexes will return above their 10 year line because of covid. \n\nFor the last 10 years tech has grown at a steady pace, each year a new phone with a little better gadgetry, newer and better computers every year, but at a reasonable pace. My last laptop was a high end hp i7 top model with everything, it took 7 years for it to become outdated to the point of replacment becoming neccessary. Nowadays you\'re lucky to get more than 3 years out of one because tech is snowballing, just slowly. \n\nCovid has changed the game entirely, retail stores like Macy\'s or best buy could become a rarity, maybe not extinct but you wont have 3 Macy\'s in 1 city. Movie theaters could go extinct if we get a second wave over the winter, while drive ins are making a come back. Meanwhile techs snowball is building momentum. Post covid, how many businesses or organizations will no longer send people on a plane to physically go to a meeting when they can just use zoom or teams. Why go to the DMV for tabs when for an extra $3 you can do it online anytime in minutes. Why go to a grocery store for 5 items where you know you\'ll end up getting 20 items when you could just instacart your shopping list and avoid the temptations and lines. Not everything will change forever and we will all eventually have a normal life with travel and such, but a lot of changes will become permanent changes. A lot of people who have been working from home due to covid are still working from home because its easier for everyone, my gf is one of them. These changes will most positively affect these Nasdaq indexs that just took the biggest hit. \n\nSeptember is historically the worst month for the market especially with elections coming up and I bet its a volatile one. But I still bet a bullish one with lots of windows of opportunities to make any money back these 3 days just cost you. \n\nIts almost like the market just went, ""oh these techs are overvalued and people are going back to work covid is going away. Back to the real world stocks cuz tech is gonna drop now and things like travel are going to take off again.""\n\nIn reality travel wont be the same for years, remember 9/11, this is worse. Yes people will take vacations but they cant fully load planes for who knows how long and their business travel income is near nil. \n\nNasdaq 10 year history https://imgur.com/gallery/uvBWbl5\n\nThis run wont end until the fed raises rates to combat inflation. But for these 10 years, these interest rates have continually gone down causing the market to go up. What youre describing is more of a full on bear market rally coming and that could last years. I doubt that will happen until the fed makes a move and currently they are still propping us up. \n\nI read everything you wrote and its a good analysis of a pattern, and I need this oppositional viewpoint. I think right now is a time to be cautious as its going to be a volatile couple months coming, but I don\'t think tech has reached its plateau yet, this is simply a bear trap, the deepest one yet which may indicate we are finally entering the blowout phase which is the final phase in the bull market. \n\nBull market cycle https://imgur.com/gallery/G90RP4L\n\nWhat we just went theough was the momentum phase. Heres the last 2 parts of that phase described; \nFirst sentiment extreme – Attitude towards the market is healthy and able to sustain a strong trend, and sentiment doesn’t become moderately extreme until the end of the phase.\n\n(This was August, strong trend until sentiment becomes extreme at the end.)\n\nBear trap – Concerns regarding overvaluation and an ending cycle feed a correction. However, the dip ends with a new round of buyers and provides a base for the next leg of the cycle.\n\n(We are literally just entering this today, we started to see a low volume of buyers come in. Tomorrow is likely also a greener day like you said, but I think it will sustain through the complete blowout phase. Which lasts about 10% of the bull market, so if this market has been running for 10 years this finaly ohase could last another year.)\n\nIn the coming days/weeks we will see renewed optimism set in as levels return to previous highs before true euphoria comes rushing in. \n\n\nTo be fair here: Bear market cycle https://imgur.com/gallery/gUEESiB\n\nAnd I totally understand how that could make you think we are entering that, afterall its descriptions are \n\nShot across the bow – This is the first major decline following the blow-off phase. It serves as a warning shot, marked by a fast and furious sell-off. This breaks the ‘animal spirits’ of the bull market as collectively market participants begin to become less certain about the future.\n\nBull-trap – The rally following the first decline off the high stabilizes market sentiment for the time-being, giving investors a false sense of confidence that the sell-off was nothing more than a sharp, but healthy correction.\n\nThe\xa0Lower-high – Buying pressure fades as skepticism leads to selling. The market begins to behave differently than it had after prior corrections by stalling and creating a major lower-high.\n\nHowever I still think we have yet to see the blowout phase of the bull market, it wasnt 1 month in duration. This is the telling week(s), if it retakes its old high lines its a bear trap, if it cannot retake old highs and hits resistance at the 21 and 10 day it could be a bull trap. \n\nI think the trickle effect you mentioned is what will cause the fed to drop the ball and everything to come falling down on itself, but I bet that doesnt happen until next year. Yes certain businesses are already closing, but the economy is not collapsing on itself in a way that affects companies like the amazons and apples of the world. Do you realize Amazon and apple combined make up over 20% of the entire stock market. So yes when they dip we all dip, but they wont crash cuz a few businesses closed. It will take wide spread poverty before they crash and burn.\n\nAt the very least, here is an opposing view.', '[deleted]', 'Let it crash im planning on holding for 10 years anyway.', 'Who cares if it crashes.

I don\'t think that makes sense. As for Softbank, they bought calls in mainly the FAANG stocks, they didn\'t buy Calls on the whole market. Could Tech stocks crashing back to say, April levels, bring us back to SPY under 300? Sure. But re-test and breach the March lows?

It\'s supposed to be a measure of US domiciled publicly traded companies Market Cap vs the GDP of the US. What it doesn\'t take into account however, is that most US business do business overseas, and not just in the US. Therefore, it\'s no longer a good measure for how ""over valued"" or ""under valued"" a US company is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Google trend results for ""Market Crash"" are trending up. Last week, which only accounted for 3 days, really, already topped the June mini-crash.\n\nI checked this out, and it doesn\'t seem to be the case.

Also, the Japan example is so overdone when it comes to stoking fears. There are significant differences between 1989 Japan and 2020 USA. For one, at the market peak in Japan, the P/E ratio reached a staggering 60+ on the Nikkei. We\'re nowhere near those levels currently. Second, Japan has an aging population, and they don\'t have very liberal immigration policies, which has resulted in a stagnant population growth over the last 3 decades.\n\nBeyond the inconsistencies in your analysis, you\'ve also got the other side of the coin.

Combine that with pent up spending demand from people quarantining, and you have a recipe for a possible continuation of this bull market, which is being priced in, as we can see from the new *all time highs* we literally hit just last week.\n\nNow the flip side to all of this, is that you guys in the US have an absolutely corrupt, asshole narcissist running the country, and as a result, your response to COVID is woefully insufficient. With Flu season approaching, it\'s possible a significant resurgence in cases results in businesses shutting down again.

Let's consider the Minsky-Kindleberger understanding of credit markets: there are three kinds of borrowers in the market at any given time. There are hedge borrowers who can make interest payments, and pay down debt. There are speculative borrowers who can make interest payments, but not pay down debt - they rely on asset prices increasing to improve equity (think of NINJA subprime holders). There are ponzi borrowers who pay down interest on debt only by borrowing further. \n\nA crash tightens credit markets. Ponzi borrowers go bust, because they can no longer borrow to pay down debt. Some speculative borrowers effectively become Ponzi borrowers as their equity collapses and perhaps as credit becomes tighter. Some hedge borrowers may become speculative borrowers. Further tightening causes Ponzi borrowers to collapse once more, and so the dance completes.\n\nThe great solution of Minsky is to have a lender of last resort. And right now we have a very Powellful LoLR. There was a moment in March that looked like a Minsky moment, but the Fed acted and the moment passed. You can say a lot about the present, but we are at no risk of a credit crunch. And while the Fed's actions were unprecedented in American history, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan both hold assets representing a far greater share of their country's GDPs. \n\nI will grant, I think there is some froth in the market right now. But markets won't panic like they did in March because the Fed has demonstrated its willingness to at least keep the banking system afloat. \n\nWe should note that markets don't have to go up or down, they can be sideways for a long time. An overvalued market with a strong lender of last resort may do just that - slowly drift towards some more sustainable - lower - equilibrium with occasional tumbles (halted by a proactive central bank). Incidentally, if you want to argue that American is Japan we should look at Japan's experience. Japan had a great fall in 1991, but much of what followed was not a crash but a sideways market and a sideways economy characterized by malaise. \n\nBears might be right, but not necessarily right away. Trying to short a sideways market can be exhausting - even as the Nikkei fell 75% from 1991-2009, it had five major booms in that period that would have broken many a short-seller.

Here\'s how I think we ended up where are today:\n\nMost of the value in the market, say 75%, is institutional money managed with fixed % allocations.  Say 50/50 equity/bonds.  QE pushed the value of bonds up (and promises to keep them there); together with the drop in equity values, that mechanically caused a massive flood of cash into equities.  The equity portfolio managers then have to pick stocks.  They may think everything is a Sell, but they have no choice.  So they hold their nose and put the cash where it seems safest - tech, Netflix, Zoom, etc.  Or they\'re following their benchmark index to a T, to reduce the chance they\'ll get fired.  \n\nIf stocks go down, institutions will sell bonds to top up equities.  Bonds can\'t go down, because of the Fed they\'re a bottomless pool of money.  So if stocks drop 30%, the overall portfolio is down 15%, so stocks will get topped up until they\'re only down 15%.  Traders frontrun the reallocation trade (either as an intentional strategy or because they believe ""stocks only go up""), so stocks are only down 15%.  Which means they should only be down 7.5%....then 3.75%... \n\nThe same mechanism could limit how much stocks can go up, but with bonds as expensive as they are, institutions might be more inclined to let the ""house money"" stay in equities.  And no one is rushing in to short the market to correct prices (that strategy hasn\'t worked very well this year).\n\nTLDR: stocks haven\'t crashed *because they can\'t*.\n\nThere are a bunch of side plots going on at the same time, e.g. the options feedback loop.  And one way the above could fail is this: the Fed corporate debt programs have about $1 trillion.  If and when the market starts exercising this put, the $1T will be gone in a day.  The Fed doesn\'t have enough ammo.  They can reload but that may take time, and it would lead to some awful outcomes like the Fed owning worthless defaulted bonds issued in August 2020, where the proceeds were immediately dividend\'ed out to the PE company that controls the issuer.\n\nCMBS are another potential hole.  Last I heard the market is still essentially frozen, so as not to look down.  But as more CMBS defaults it will get harder to pretend they\'re worth the same as they used to be.\n\nA couple other theories supportive of the market:\n\n* the Fed created so much cash that cash is now worth less (in terms of asset purchasing power, not CPI purchasing power, which are pretty loosely linked these days); so companies are worth less, but so is money;\n* most of the S&P 500 will survive; many of their competitors won\'t.

Similarly, if I were to be a portfolio manager, I\'d have allocations set out for stocks. Look at how much Tesla grew in the last few months. It would be a significant part of portfolios. Their strategy isn\'t just to buy and hold and keep buying. That\'s not how active management works.\n\n3) People just throw around the world overvalued and undervalued using arbitrary numbers that MAYBE are just good for relative comparisons but don\'t really tell us anything in and of itself. Let\'s take Apple as an example.

Apple\'s is slightly higher now but it\'s more in line with the rest.\n\nMy point isn\'t to be like your end outcome might be wrong.

Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains for tax purposes, except if the stock sold for a loss is bought back within 30 days(wash sale).

Sorry. **I haven’t looked into why specifically, but** it likely doesn’t generate the same money as a brokerage account.\n\nIt has nothing to do with generating money because IRAs held by fiduciaries are actually great sources of interest and fees because IRAs *aren\'t free.* You can\'t offer free investing with a wrapped product (like an IRA) because the fees will be built into the product. You don\'t know anything. That\'s the problem here; you\'re admitting you know absolutely nothing but trying to write a scalding criticism and getting incredible attention while being wholly ignorant.\n\nThis is what\'s wrong with the community at the moment; RH is a scapegoat for your frustration at your ignorance.\n\n>Also, it’s a tech company, not a financial services company. Not inherently a bad thing, but a company who’s core competency is software development, and not equities trading, I’d think twice.\n\nThe only ""financial services companies"" are dinosaurs that ""boomers"" use. TastyTrade, Webull, hell even Acorns (wut?) are not  Financial Services sector companies. Whether you\'re talking SoFi or M1 or any number of brokers in the modern space most of them don\'t meet this criteria at all. In fact the greater majority of them run through partnerships and banks that have zero stake in the Clearing Houses used.\n\nThis is schizophrenic.\n\n>Leadership - the congressional hearings were pathetic... what is core to leadership? Seeking responsibility for your actions. This ceo needs to hire someone else to be the point man, he isn’t ready for the big leagues.\n\nIt\'s a tech company made for little dudes like you to go on rants on the internet after trading irresponsibly in ways no one can rationally fathom.

If I wanted to do those things, I’d use a platform that was designed for those activities. Robinhood is not one of those platforms.

I’ve never once had an issue with my investments that required me to immediately speak to a representative, and I have used many different brokerages over the years, including brokerages not based in the United States.

How risk averse are you? How long are you willing to keep your money in the market? This will help you inform your decisions from then on out.\n\nPay attention to what people are talking about and why. The more something is talked about, the more likely it is that the stock is seeing action now. This does NOT mean that the stock is necessarily a good investment. You should never invest in something just because others are doing it, you should never invest in something that you don\'t understand, and never invest money that you can\'t afford to lose. Seriously. If you have a $50,000 of total wealth, and $30k is tied up, you should never consider investing the entire $20k liquid amount that is on hand. Set limits on what you choose to put into your brokerage account.\n\n""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""\n\nThis is a quote that I try and live by. GME has been a good example lately. I invested when others were fearful of its bankruptcy, months ago, and I sold when others were greedy, even though it felt like I was the only one selling and that I could be \'missing out\' on lots of gains. Never FOMO into an investment. That\'s gambling, not investing\n\nNext, once you have identified a company that is interesting, you have to research it and seek to full understand the company. This can be a daunting task, and should take a lot of effort. On average, I spend anywhere from 20 to 200 hours researching a company before deciding to invest. Don\'t invest in what you don\'t understand and always prioritize learning more over waiting less.\n\nNext, if you are looking to value invest, consider a companies\' balance sheet, history, management, and future market value. Is the company managing their finances well? Are there any alarming liabilities? Are they perceived well by the public and other investors? Are they consistently growing? Are they hiring new employees? How is their trading volume changing? Have they shifted their position in the market to be more competitive? Are they pursuing any new visions? Do they have any unique business moats? What are the strongest bullish and bearish analysis of the company? Read everything. Seek to understand everything. Ask questions. Find answers. Share your analysis. Receive feedback. Consider catalysts and make your own estimates for stock growth.\n\nThen, once you have found something, do NOT go all in. Invest a speculative position. Once you learn more, and are more convicted regarding the stock, buy more. All of my large positions have started off as speculative positions that I continue to buy over time. No conviction = No monetization. \n\nThis might be more than your question was asking, but I think it all relates.\n\nThis is not financial advice.

That’s why if you plan to hold long term you should be especially concerned about value.\nHolding long doesn’t justify paying too much, it’s the opposite. You can pay too much if you are holding short term and taking advantage of a trend.\nOverpaying to hold long term, you are betting that the market will stay irrational until your company eventually grows into its inflated price.

With that being addressed let look at the tax burden that will come due when the bond matures.  Florida has a 3 percent cap on property taxes (originally put in place to protect the elderly on fixed incomes) if you have homestead.  All of these rental properties do not have that protection so while most people who own and live in homes will see an increase. It will be the real estate investors that take the hit.  This will have two impacts, it will finally slow the housing price inflation issue we are having down here, and maybe bring more revenue in taxes from other states and countries to pay off that debt.

However, this stock had some pretty bad press release and the stock basically crashed/underperformed so although it is okay to discuss about portfolios do not jump on any train instantly. People also have to realize when to take in gains especially for short term investments... a couple of stocks i believed in the 'diamond' hands theory and basically got caught up in a pump and dump. It can be very euphoric to see this sharp rise in unrealized gains, yet also have to be diligent on the sharp rise. Whenever you see sharp gains and not steady gains be ready to take in gains is what i've learned. Sharp gains is always something suspicious to look out for and you can always just take the gains and let things simmer a while then reinvest using those gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLEASE Do not feel bad about taking in gains FOR SHORT term investments/ any sort of panic buy. Any gains is better than seeing negative gains and leaving a position. It is OPPORTUNITY cost that decides at the end of the day --> that large gain can be used to be invest in another company instead of a dying company. It all varies a lot between the company and your own mentality of how legit the company is. I got stuck up on not leaving a position and seeing my +4k unrealized gains gone in a flash of an eye is pretty depressing and made me want to just dump my portfolio all into index/ dividend stocks and forget up on the market. Now I am grateful for any gains and took my time in picking a SINGULAR stock rather than trying to find five different stocks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire long term investment should apply if the company makes sense to you and you can see how it can survive in the long run. Make sure to always search thoroughly about a company and not fall for suspicious ones. Do not confuse a fallacy of diamond hands of a dying company while it has no plans of changing its revenue/model, there is opportunity cost of where you money could be in, so sometimes a loss is okay to exit. Honestly even now i feel like a magic eight ball can be more useful than my judgement on some days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n: im not a financial advisor, but do not be afraid to take in gains and do not let some random internet person tell you 'do not sell just HOLD' or call you out for being a 'bag holder' although yes it is correct to somewhat hold to start a 'squeeze' but is your 10-20 stocks really going to move the market with such a large market cap? Take the 50% gain and place it somewhere else where it can SURVIVE and GROW that is an INVESTMENT. Playing into some hype stock is just a gamble/game.  never forget opportunity cost. However, I do own GME stocks for other reasons as it is a special case... I have just seen weed stonks crash hard on people and it was sad to see close friends lose money.

Investors got burned from 2014-2020 because of shale oil. Many small time oil companies were bankrupt from this time period. They don\'t want a repeat of that. The Saudi\'s intentionally flooded the market with cheap oil from this same period because they wanted to weed out the other oil producers who couldn\'t survive with the smaller margins. Only the big players could survive. If you check the stock performance of oil companies from 2014, you were basically losing money while the rest of the stock market climbed significantly.\n2. Refining capacitiy is down because the ROI isn\'t there to justify building a new one when renewables are becoming a higher point of focus.\n3. The U.S. government is disincentivizing the drilling of new oil fields. Regulations are incredibly high. At the end of the day, oil companies operate the same as a regular mom-and-pop business: ""Does it make financial sense?"" The answer right now is no. You might remember the Keystone Pipeline XL being shut down. Well, it was initially approved so work was started. After spending a projected total of $15 billion, TC Energy then had their permit revoked by Biden. Ask yourself: Why would anyone want to take that risk? Yes, it might be allowed now. But just as easily, it can be shut down. That uncertainty is at a level where it becomes unappealing.\n4. The war decreases the amount of available oil supply because of sanctions imposed. This means you have more countries bidding on the same supply of oil driving the prices up higher.\n5. OPEC has ZERO incentive to increase the supply and lower the prices. Saudi Arabia, for instance, knows that oil is finite and that their cash cow won\'t be around in say, 20 years. They have been divesting away from oil quickly in preparation of this. That is why you are seeing Saudi Arabia spend billions of $ in other areas to ramp up their economy.\n\nIs it Biden\'s fault? The serious answer is no but the long answer is his initiatives are making is increasingly difficult for oil companies to want to increase production and refining capacity. When you want to go green, there is a transition that will happen. This is that transition period where you are going to see high oil prices for the foreseeable future in the hopes that it will pay off in the long run when renewables are the dominant player and EV\'s become the norm.

Not drilling is much better for their long term profits. \n\nCEO pay incentives have also been restructured. They used to be instructed to drill and now they are paid to return money to shareholders.

When you make a call to another number (even if the other phone is just inches away), the signal first has to travel to the nearest antenna, which forwards it to the core network. The core network will determine where the destination phone/user is located, and forwards it to the antenna where that user is currently registered at.  There are tons of devices, computers, server/cloud farms that are involved in making this happen.  \n\nThere are tens of thousands of pages of standards document specifying on how the communication between the different components is made (by an organisation called 3GPP, where any company that has anything to do with telecoms is a member), and behind these specifications, tens of thousands of patents.  \n\nLook at this list from late 2019, for example, regarding 5G patents\n\n[https://www.iplytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Who-Leads-the-5G-Patent-Race\\_2019.pdf](https://www.iplytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Who-Leads-the-5G-Patent-Race_2019.pdf)\n\nAs you can see, Apple, which everyone seems to declare as the leaders in 5G, has only 52 granted patents related to 5G, while Nokia has almost 1700! To compare, after working for 12 years at Nokia and Ericsson, I am a co-author of more than 400 patents on 4G/5G (of which around 100 are already granted)  and I had some senior colleagues at Ericsson who have more than a 1000 patents filed (and of which 400+ granted) in 4G/5G. And these patents are not only what happens on the network side (Base stations, core network), but also on how/what the phone does  (how the data is encrypted, how the data is compressed, how the data is converted into radio signals, how to make sure data will not be lost due to poor radio by repetitions/retransmission,  how to ensure that there is a seamless hand over from one antenna to another antenna when the user moves while on a call or data session without any data loss or interruption, on how the phone connects to more than one antenna whenever possible to get as much data rate as possible, etc...)\n\nUntil recently, Apple was just using the technology that is developed by tens of thousands of researchers from all over the world in companies that most people probably have not even heard of or the likes of Nokia and Ericsson, who are not producing phones anymore and ppl think are not active anymore.  \n\nPS: Apple is stepping up their game in telecom R&D, specially after buying the mobile chipset part of Intel a couple of years ago. So they can be major players in the 6G system that is going to be developed during this decade. But until now, Apple more or less waited for the technology to be developed by others, and implemented the technology once it has been certified by 3GPP, and paid licensing fees for the others to make use of the technology.', 'Let WSB pump it up and then dilute the shares through a direct offering for millions of dollars. retain your employees', 'Welp, not supporting layoffs, especially now.
